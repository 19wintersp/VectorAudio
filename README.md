# Releases

See [releases](https://github.com/pierr3/VectorAudio/releases) for latest builds

# Usage

 - Open the application, fill in the settings page, then hit save.
 - Connect to VATSIM through EuroScope, wait till the client detects your connection, then click connect in VectorAudio.
 - Add the required frequencies through the right menu (CAUTION: Do not add two frequencies which are the same)
 - Use RX to receive, TX to transmit, XC to cross-couple
 - If anything acts up, delete the frequency using "X" and add it back
